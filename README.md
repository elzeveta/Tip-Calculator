# Tip-Calculator

## How to implement

To find out the tip we will take input from the user: Bill Amount (it is the amount of the total bill, we are taking this into amount variable), for the type of service we are using a drop-down menu having quality as the options in percentage (like good, bad, excellent, etc.), lastly, we are taking the number of persons as input (it will help to divide the tip equally among all the person). A per the inputs from the user, we are calculating the tip and then printing it using the console.log() function.

Total is basically amount multiplied by type of service divided by a number of persons.

## Technical Part

Using HTML we are giving desired structure, option for the input, and submit button. With the help of CSS, we are beautifying our structure by giving colors and desired font, etc.

In the JavaScript section, we are processing the taken input and after calculating, the respective output is printed.
